## Most projects offer “[main domain]/security”

* http://symfony.com/security
* http://framework.zend.com/security
* http://www.yiiframework.com/security
* https://www.drupal.org/security 
* http://www.revive-adserver.com/security
* http://magento.com/security 
* http://www.apache.org/security
* https://www.mozilla.org/security
* http://wordpress.org/security
* http://typo3.org/security
* http://joomla.org/security

Some have that as a blog category, some list disclosures, some detail the disclosure process, some just have a report
form

## Contacting

* Email: Most provide an email address like "security@[main domain]" 
* Form: Yii + Joomla provides a contact form (this seems highly risky, since the website itself is likely also hosted on code
  the same code base that might be affected). Drupal has a dedicated system built on drupal.
* ZendFramework uses zf-security@zend.com 
* SugarCRM uses secure@sugarcrm.com
* WordPress, Revive  uses HackerOne

https://hackerone.com/directory aims to provide a listing of security contact info for hackerone and non-hackerone
projects.

## Methods for publishing security issues: 

* Mailinglist : OpenBSD, Mailinglist, TYPO3, Horde, Symfony
* Feed: ZendFramework, TYPO3, Drupal 
* Blog: Symfony 
* CVE: Symfony, Drupal
* Dedicated page: Drupal, Joomla, ZendFramework
